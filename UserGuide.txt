Game play instructions:

Our game is a game where the user types the characters of a random (not always english) 
word that is floating towards the bottom of the screen, at which the word will be 
shortened by each character they type (for example “hello” will become “ello” after 
the user types the “h” key). After they type out the entire word, said word disappears, 
and the user should focus on the next word, which is also heading towards the bottom of 
the screen. If any word reaches the bottom of the screen, the game is over. 
On this game over screen, the user can view their score and level. 
The score is increased every time the user types out a correct character and 
shortens a word (no points are awarded to mistyped keys), while each level is 
incremented after 10 score points (so 10 characters typed). Further, the speed at 
which the words travel down the screen increases as the user increments to each new level.
After the game ends, the user can type the “r” key to restart the game and play again, 
however, their score and level will start back from 0 again.
